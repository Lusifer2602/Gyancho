#Gyancho
This app has been written for students and teachers to collaborate, share, learn, and exchange knowledge.

The app has been written on Flask Framework in Python making it faster and scalable.

Description
The team has designed this project with the idea in mind to create an echo chamber for students and teachers to mutually exchange informative content with each other, may it be video lectures, pdf files, image files and other forms of documents.


We created the application on Flask framework keeping in mind that it'd later be possible to deploy it directly on web services, may it be any cloud based platform, or web3 apps, we have ensured this application is easily scalable.

There's also special privileges provided to individual roles in terms of sharing media, making announcements.
We have ensured to create an admin privilege system as well that allows the admin to add, remove users and also create or delete pre uploaded posts in case any explicit content is detected.

We have added support to uploading files and they are saved in the uploads folder that helps us use github as database if we are hosting it online.
